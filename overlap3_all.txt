At every excavation site a rig is setup to extract the oil. The only mode to reach a rig is by a boat. Men who would like to reach a rig use special purpose boats which can run on crude fuel available at the rigs and the shore. These boats can run a mile for every unit of fuel they consume. Each man on the boat consumes a unit of food for every mile he travels. Boats have a limited load capacity. The net weight, including the weight of fuel, food and the men, on boat should never exceed its load capacity. The weight of one unit of fuel is same as the weight of one unit of food. However, as the rigs are far from the shore in the sea it is usually a very long sail. The capacity of the boat available for fuel may not be sufficient to reach the destination rig directly. In such cases, the men may goto a near by rig to load required fuel. The men can also store food at the rigs as well as at the shore for later consumption. They must buy all the food they require to reach the destination rig at the shore only. And all the men who started should be together throughout the sail.\r You should now write a program which can help these men decide the minimum amount of food they require to reach the destination rig. The positions of rigs and the boat's starting point are indicated as co-ordinates of a two dimensional plane with x and y axises of 1 mile units. Food at shore is available only in whole units.\r Assume that the food and fuel are consumed continuously, that is if you travel a partial mile the number of units of food and fuel consumed is equal to portion of mile traveled.\r Input\r The first line of input has a list of integers terminated by -1. The first integer is the capacity of the boat. The integers following it up to -1 are the weights of men who need to reach the destination rig.\r Lines following will have two integers separated by a space, each line indicating the x and y coordinates of a coordinate pair respectively. The input will be terminated by a coordinate pair (0,0) and this should not be processed. The first co-ordinate pair indicates the position of the boat's starting point. The last coordinate pair indicates the position of the destination rigs. All other points indicate the position of various rigs in the sea in a random order.\r Output\r Your program should print the minimum amount of food required to reach the destination.

Question is as follows.\r You want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements.\r     You want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.\r     You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.\r You have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.\r The input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:\r                        41111921111119\r                        11119   11119\r If the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.\r Center of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211\r Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum / regular sum = 60 / 15 = 4\r This means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)/2 = 4.5.\r Here is an example problem:\r 131251141231 ---- ----\r If we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231.

A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.\r   Input Specification\r Your program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.\r The first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.\r The next ceiling(n / 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

Unfortunately, your boss is going to be extremely unhappy, and wants you to exactly minimize the losses to the absolute minimum possible without crashing the plane.

This argument must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should output to standard out the minimum losses your boss will incur from your ejection of goods (see below).

While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.\r Being an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.\r Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.\r   Input specifications\r The input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.\r Example input file: \r1  0.0      0.0\r2  10.1     -10.1\r3  -12.2    12.2\r4  38.3     38.3\r5  79.99    179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.\r   Output specifications\r In the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last.\r Example output: \r1 2,3,4\r2 1,3,4\r3 1,2,4\r4 1,2,3\r5 4,3,1", "qn14411705.txt:::Question Number 1\r Consider a table \"Student\" consisting of columns (Student ID, Student Address, Course).\r Every student is allowed to enroll in multiple courses and every course is allowed to enroll more than one student.

A packet can be any size unbounded.\r The \u2018total\u2019 length of the packet will be cbTotalPacketLen, each chunk in the packet will have this same length set in the chunk header.\rThe \u2018length\u2019 of the current chunk will be always \u2018cbThisChunkLen\u2019.\r The ProcessData(...) routine will be called many times, with whatever data has arrived from the network. The network is reliable so data will arrive in sequence it was sent. However as this is a TCP stream, not a message there is no guarantee that the call to ProcessData will correspond to a complete chunk. I\r That is important point, ProcessData may be called many times for even one CHUNK. And may be called with an arbitrary number of bytes each time ranging from just one byte.\r Your goal: with ProcessData(\u2026) is to implement a routine that reads the stream and the CHUNKs and from that reconstructs a _complete_ Packet (i.e. has data from all chunks in the packet). Once a packet is constructed you should pass it to a routine:\r HRESULT ProcessPacket(PBYTE pPacketBytes, IN ULONG cbCompletePacketSize); //you do not need to implement this.
