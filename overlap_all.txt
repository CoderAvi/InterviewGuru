Since that whole relationship thing hasn't been working out for you recently, that loved one will have to be your cat, Sophie. Unfortunately you find yourself spending considerable time after you arrive home just trying to find her. Being a perfectionist and unable to let anything suboptimal be a part of your daily life, you decide to devise the most efficient possible method for finding Sophie.\r Luckily for you, Sophie is a creature of habit. You know where all of her hiding places are, as well as the probability of her hiding in each one. You also know how long it takes you to walk from hiding place to hiding place. Write a program to determine the minimum expected time it will take to find Sophie in your apartment. It is sufficient to simply visit a location to check if Sophie is hiding there; no time must be spent looking for her at a location. Sophie is hiding when you enter your apartment, and then will not leave that hiding place until you find her. Your program must take the name of an input file as an argument on the command line.\r   Input Specifications\r The input file starts with a single number, m, followed by a newline. m is the number of locations available for Sophie to hide in your apartment. This line is followed by m lines, each containing information for a single location of the form (brackets for clarity):\r <location name>  <probability>probability is the probability that Sophie is hiding in the location indicated. The sum of all the probabilities is always 1. The contents of these lines are separated by whitespace. Names will only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ('_'), and there will be no duplicate names. All input is guaranteed to be well-formed. Your starting point is the first location to be listed, and in effect it costs you no time to check if Sophie is there.\r The file continues with a single number, c, followed by a newline. c is the number of connections that exist between the various locations. This line is followed by c lines, each of the form:\r <location name>  <location name>  <seconds> The first two entries are the names of locations and seconds is the number of seconds it takes you to walk between the them. Again these lines are whitespace-delimited. Note that the locations are unordered; you can walk between them in either direction and it will take the same amount of time.

Question is as follows.\r You want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements.\r     You want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.\r     You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.\r You have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.\r The input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:\r                        41111921111119\r                        11119   11119\r If the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.\r Center of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211\r Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum / regular sum = 60 / 15 = 4\r This means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)/2 = 4.5.\r Here is an example problem:\r 131251141231 ---- ----\r If we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231\r Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 Weight sum of the masses: 2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 Weighted sum / regular sum = 63 / 14 = 4.5\r This puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is\r 0 8 4\r Because the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4", "qn401540.txt:::Given a cube.
