While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.\r Being an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.\r Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.\r   Input specifications\r The input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.\r Example input file: \r1  0.0      0.0\r2  10.1     -10.1\r3  -12.2    12.2\r4  38.3     38.3\r5  79.99    179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.\r   Output specifications\r In the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last.\r Example output: \r1 2,3,4\r2 1,3,4\r3 1,2,4\r4 1,2,3\r5 4,3,1", "qn7208176.txt:::First the interviewer have called me on time, he introduced himself and his project which takes about 10 minutes, then he asked me why do you want to join facebook..\rThen he started in the technical questions, the first questions was:\rhe described to me a game called othelo (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) which is a 2 player board game using for example X and O, if player X placed X in an empty space\r_OOOX\rthe O's between the two X's will be converted to X\rXOOOX ==> XXXXX\rthis will happen on the current row, column, and the two diagonals in every directions\rand if the following case happened\r__OOX\rand the X player placed X in the first space\rX_OOX\rnothing occured for the two Os\r given a certain state of the board, location on the board, a certain piece\rto place on the given location\r update the board, and make the required validations\r Then I started to code the required method, then have revised it and fixed small bugs, then he told me that it seems to be working.\r then we turned to the second question:\rwhich is given a Collection<String> words, return a Collection<String> of anagrams found in the given collection for example \"The rat fell in the tar\" => returned [rat tar]\r Then I have discussed him in an algorithm with O(n k lg k) where n is the number of words and k is the average length of the word, then I started to code it and then he said that it seems to be working.\r then the interview is finished.\r Notes:\r* Try to practice a lot before the interview, by solving such problems and try to mimic the interview environment by coding in the collabedit.com text editor\r* Don't use Ctrl + S while coding in collabedit as it may lead to some problems.\r* Don't be afraid before the interview, just calm down as the interviewers are very friendly.\r Good Luck :)", "qn13225716.txt:::An expression consisting of operands and binary operators can be written in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) by writing both the operands followed by the operator.

Since that whole relationship thing hasn't been working out for you recently, that loved one will have to be your cat, Sophie. Unfortunately you find yourself spending considerable time after you arrive home just trying to find her. Being a perfectionist and unable to let anything suboptimal be a part of your daily life, you decide to devise the most efficient possible method for finding Sophie.\r Luckily for you, Sophie is a creature of habit. You know where all of her hiding places are, as well as the probability of her hiding in each one. You also know how long it takes you to walk from hiding place to hiding place. Write a program to determine the minimum expected time it will take to find Sophie in your apartment. It is sufficient to simply visit a location to check if Sophie is hiding there; no time must be spent looking for her at a location. Sophie is hiding when you enter your apartment, and then will not leave that hiding place until you find her. Your program must take the name of an input file as an argument on the command line.\r   Input Specifications\r The input file starts with a single number, m, followed by a newline. m is the number of locations available for Sophie to hide in your apartment. This line is followed by m lines, each containing information for a single location of the form (brackets for clarity):\r <location name>  <probability>probability is the probability that Sophie is hiding in the location indicated. The sum of all the probabilities is always 1. The contents of these lines are separated by whitespace. Names will only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ('_'), and there will be no duplicate names. All input is guaranteed to be well-formed. Your starting point is the first location to be listed, and in effect it costs you no time to check if Sophie is there.\r The file continues with a single number, c, followed by a newline. c is the number of connections that exist between the various locations. This line is followed by c lines, each of the form:\r <location name>  <location name>  <seconds> The first two entries are the names of locations and seconds is the number of seconds it takes you to walk between the them. Again these lines are whitespace-delimited. Note that the locations are unordered; you can walk between them in either direction and it will take the same amount of time. No duplicate pairs will be included in the input file, and all location names will match one described earlier in the file.\r Example input file: \r4\rfront_door    .2\rin_cabinet    .3\runder_bed     .4\rbehind_blinds .1\r5\rfront_door under_bed     5\runder_bed  behind_blinds 9\rfront_door behind_blinds 5\rfront_door in_cabinet    2\rin_cabinet behind_blinds 6\r   Output Specifications\r Your output must consist of a single number followed by a newline, printed to standard out. The number is the minimum expected time in seconds it takes to find Sophie, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Make sure that the number printed has exactly two digits after the decimal point (even if they are zeroes). If it is impossible to guarantee that you will find Sophie, print \"-1.00\" followed by a newline instead.\r Example output: \r6.00", "qn15501897.txt:::This Question was asked in written round on one of the online coding round, The Question was to code this. Question is as follows.\r You want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements.\r     You want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.\r     You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.\r You have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.\r The input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:\r                        41111921111119\r                        11119   11119\r If the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.\r Center of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211\r Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum / regular sum = 60 / 15 = 4\r This means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)/2 = 4.5.\r Here is an example problem:\r 131251141231 ---- ----\r If we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231\r Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 Weight sum of the masses: 2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 Weighted sum / regular sum = 63 / 14 = 4.5\r This puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is\r 0 8 4\r Because the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4", "qn12150672.txt:::You have a room-full of balances and weights.

We did it this way: The two bullies of our gully would appoint themselves captains of the opposing teams, and then they would take turns picking other players. On each round, a captain would choose the most capable (or, towards the end, the least inept) player from the pool of remaining candidates, until everyone present had been assigned to one side or the other. The aim of this ritual was to produce two evenly matched teams and, along the way, to remind each of us of our precise ranking in the neighbourhood pecking order.\r We all believed this was the fairest process, but does it ensure the fairest selection of players with evenly matched teams? We believed so, but then there were times when, as the game progressed we realized that the other team was stronger than ours and may be an exchange of a couple of players between the teams would have made them balanced. That scope of improvement seemed to be there...\r Here, we need to find a way to create two evenly balanced teams for any game(or as evenly balanced as possible considering the strength of each player). A set of players must be divided into two teams. Each player must be on one team or the other; the number of player on the two teams must not differ by more than 1; each player will have a skill-point associated with him. The total skill-points of the players on each team should be as nearly equal as possible.(The absolute difference of the sum of skill-points of players in each team should be the least).\r Input:\r The first line of input shall contain N, the total number of players. N lines will follow with the first line giving the skill-point of person 1; the second line, the skill-point of person 2; and so on. Each skill-point shall be an integer between 1 and 450.

At every excavation site a rig is setup to extract the oil. The only mode to reach a rig is by a boat. Men who would like to reach a rig use special purpose boats which can run on crude fuel available at the rigs and the shore. These boats can run a mile for every unit of fuel they consume. Each man on the boat consumes a unit of food for every mile he travels. Boats have a limited load capacity. The net weight, including the weight of fuel, food and the men, on boat should never exceed its load capacity. The weight of one unit of fuel is same as the weight of one unit of food. However, as the rigs are far from the shore in the sea it is usually a very long sail. The capacity of the boat available for fuel may not be sufficient to reach the destination rig directly. In such cases, the men may goto a near by rig to load required fuel. The men can also store food at the rigs as well as at the shore for later consumption. They must buy all the food they require to reach the destination rig at the shore only. And all the men who started should be together throughout the sail.\r You should now write a program which can help these men decide the minimum amount of food they require to reach the destination rig. The positions of rigs and the boat's starting point are indicated as co-ordinates of a two dimensional plane with x and y axises of 1 mile units. Food at shore is available only in whole units.\r Assume that the food and fuel are consumed continuously, that is if you travel a partial mile the number of units of food and fuel consumed is equal to portion of mile traveled.\r Input\r The first line of input has a list of integers terminated by -1. The first integer is the capacity of the boat. The integers following it up to -1 are the weights of men who need to reach the destination rig.\r Lines following will have two integers separated by a space, each line indicating the x and y coordinates of a coordinate pair respectively. The input will be terminated by a coordinate pair (0,0) and this should not be processed. The first co-ordinate pair indicates the position of the boat's starting point. The last coordinate pair indicates the position of the destination rigs. All other points indicate the position of various rigs in the sea in a random order.\r Output\r Your program should print the minimum amount of food required to reach the destination.
