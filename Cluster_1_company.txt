Each man on the boat consumes a unit of food for every mile he travels. Boats have a limited load capacity. The net weight, including the weight of fuel, food and the men, on boat should never exceed its load capacity. The weight of one unit of fuel is same as the weight of one unit of food. However, as the rigs are far from the shore in the sea it is usually a very long sail. The capacity of the boat available for fuel may not be sufficient to reach the destination rig directly. In such cases, the men may goto a near by rig to load required fuel. The men can also store food at the rigs as well as at the shore for later consumption.

Here x and y denote the unique ids of the two balls.\rA simple greedy algorithm for this color assignment problem is as follows:\rI. Sort all the vertices in the graph on the basis of their degrees [This sorting should be done in-place on\rthe array of adjacency lists.]. Assume colors are ordered c1, c2, \u2026\rII. Let u be the un-colored vertex with the smallest degree. [Break ties in favor of the vertex with the\rsmaller id]\ra. Assign first color ci in the list of colors to u such that\rcolor(u) ? ci where ci != color(vj ) for any vertex vj in the adjacency list of u.\rIII. Repeat step II until all vertices are colored.\rImplement your solution using a Graph ADT that supports the following interfaces:\ra) Graph createGraph() : Creates an empty graph.\rb) Graph addEdge(Graph g, Vertex v1, Vertex v2): adds an edge from vertex v1 to vertex v2 to the graph g.\rIf a new vertex is found, then an entry has to be added in the adjacency list\rc) Iterator getNeighbors(Graph, Vertex): gets a list of neighbors of the vertex.\rd) Graph sortGraphbyDegree(Graph) : sorts the adjacency list based on degree of the vertices. The vertex\rwith smallest degree will appear first, and the vertex with the largest degree will appear last. If two\rvertices are having the same degree, then their order of appearance will not change.\re) Color chooseColor(Graph, Vertex): returns the first color in the list of colors that satisfies the condition\rmentioned in step (2) above.\rf) int assignColors(Graph) : invokes chooseColor vertex by vertex and stores the chosen color in the\rcorresponding vertex. This function returns the number of colors used.\rg) printGraph(Graph , num_colors_used, file) : prints the number of colors used, num_colors_used, in the\rfirst line of the output file. It then prints the graph into the file using the following format:\r(vertexid,color):v1,v2,v3,vn\rwhere vertexid is the unique id of the vertex, color is the color assigned to the vertex, and v1,v2,\u2026,vn\rcorrespond the unique identification numbers of the vertices that are adjacent to the current vertex.\rData structures Used:\rGraph: This is a dynamic array, such that each entry in the array contains a pointer to vertex vi, the degree of vi\rand a list of neighbors of vi.\rVertex: Each vertex contains the unique identification number of the vertex, its color.\rList: This is for the list of neighbors, such that each entry in the list corresponding to vertex vi consists of a\rpointer to vertex vj, ? vj \u00ce neighborhood(vi)\rSteps to perform:\r1. Write the relevant Header files for an adjacency list representation of Graph\r2. Write a driver file that reads an input file containing the edges in the graph and prints the graph after\rcoloring the balls. This driver uses the adjacency list for graph representation.\ra. The driver takes the name of the input file and output file as command line parameters.\rb. From the file, find number of nodes involved.\rc. For each line in the input file corresponding to an edge\ri. add the edge using call to addEdge().\rd. The driver must then invoke function sortGraphbyDegree() to sort the vertices in the increasing\rorder of their degrees.\re. Invoke assignColors to assign colours to each vertex.\rf.
